Clinical Trial Data Pipeline: CDISC-Compliant Dataset Preparation & Analysis
Project Overview
This project showcases a complete workflow for preparing and analyzing clinical trial datasets following CDISC standards (SDTM/ADaM). It demonstrates how to transform raw clinical data into submission-ready datasets and perform statistical analyses such as Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The goal is to streamline the clinical data management process while ensuring regulatory compliance.

Key Features
CDISC-Compliant Datasets

Created SDTM datasets: Demographics (DM), Adverse Events (AE), Laboratory (LB), and Survival (SV).
Built ADaM datasets: Lab analysis (ADLB) and survival analysis-ready datasets (ADSV).
Exported datasets in .xpt (SAS Transport) format for regulatory submissions.
Data Transformation & Cleaning

Used R programming to clean, standardize, and structure raw trial data.
Prepared time-to-event variables and encoded adverse events.
Statistical Analysis

Performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using survival and survminer packages.
Visualized survival curves with confidence intervals and risk tables.
Compared survival outcomes across treatment groups.
Automation

Streamlined the dataset preparation workflow for efficiency and reproducibility.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: R
Libraries: dplyr, tidyr, haven, survival, survminer
Standards: CDISC SDTM & ADaM
Outputs: Regulatory-ready .xpt files
